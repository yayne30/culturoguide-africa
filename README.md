# culturoguide-africa

The goal of CulturoGuide Africa is to provide tourists and cultural explorers with essential information about African countries. The platform will feature key details such as language, greetings, etiquette, food, festivals, places to visit, and embedded YouTube travel videos â€” all in one place, with a focus on promoting cultural awareness and respectful travel across Africa.
